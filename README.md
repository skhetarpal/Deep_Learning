# Neural Networks Built From Scratch
This repository holds code for building neural networks with backprop using nothing but numpy.

FFNN.ipynb builds a feed forward neural network from scratch.  It includes a section in which I build a model with one hidden layer and tests it on the MNIST dataset.  It acheives and accuracy of 95% by using 30 hidden units, an alpha of 0.1, a batchsize of 20, and 10 epochs of training.
